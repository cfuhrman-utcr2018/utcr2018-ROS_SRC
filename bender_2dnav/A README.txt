base_local_planner_params, costmap_common_params, global_costmap_params, and local_costmap_params define how the Navigation Stack operates. Documentaiton on this can be found on the ROS navigation stack wiki page. These are fairly standard documents. 

Note that at the time of this publishing there was an issue getting the LaserScan data into the Navigation Stack. It had something to do with the transforms and the time stamping of the data. This issue was never fully and reliable resolved (I belive).
